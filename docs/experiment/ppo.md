# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, proposed by OpenAI in 2017. PPO strikes a balance between simplicity, stability, and performance, making it one of the most widely used algorithms in modern RL applications, including large-scale language model fine-tuning.
